									<h2>The Journey so far</h2>
									<p>I had originally began the Google Data Analytics Certificate in June 2021, finishing it a month later while working full time. I had learned a lot about how data is gathered, organized, and then analyzed for insights. 
									However, I was not fully prepared for the job search to gain an entry level role in Data Analytics, and had decided to take some time for also learning FrontEnd Web Development. As of October 18th, 2021, I am currently enrolled in a 
									new program offered by Merit America that offers not only intense learning and training, but strong career coaching as well.</p>

							<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
							<p>Here are the projects that I worked on since July 2021:</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Google Data Analytics Capstone Project</h3>
									<p>The course ends with a choice between two data sets, and asks that the student conduct a Capstone project to provide an example of what was learned in the course. Using the dataset that was provided from Kaggle, I had used Rstudio to analyze the fitbit data that was provided.
									I had found that the overall usage was rather detailed, but did not entirely match what Bellabeat was offering, so I had kept the analysis high level and general to be able to compare the two. I was able to learn that the fitbit users who were the most active were also reporting longer sleep as a correlation. This could 
									be used by the Bellabeat team to inform their target audience on how to reduce stress through more exercise, as it may lead to longer sleep, which can reduce stress.</p>
									<p> Here is the R analysis for the Capstone Project:</br>

									And finally, here are the notes that I had used through the project to keep me on task: <br>

									<h3>Kaggle</h3>
									<p>Kaggle held a 30 days of ML learning event, where I was able to proceed through their courses to learn more about Python, beginner, and some intermediate Machine Learning. 
										I had completed the courses, but did not participate in the final project. I did however use the python experience, along with the documenation for the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries
										to do an exploritory analysis of a sales data set that was available on Kaggle. <br>
										The analysis can be found here:<br>
										<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tgill1085/sales-data-analysis/notebook"> Sales Data Analysis using Python </a><br><br>
										The coding examples that were completed through the Python and Machine Learning Courses through Kaggle can also be found under my Kaggle Code page:<br>

									<h3>FreeCodeCamp and REPL</h3>
									<p>Following my experience with the Sales Data Analysis, I felt that It may be good to check out any other known resources regarding Data Analysis and Python. 
									Having used FreeCodeCamp previously in learning about front end development, I was able to revisit the site and found they are offering a course in what I was looking for.
									FreeCodeCamp requires that coding exercises be submitted, and they suggest REPL for ease of use. I had written the code in my REPL repository, but have also copied it over to my 
									Github account as well. If you happen to check both, this is why you may find the same work on both sides. 
									<br><br>
									Here is my REPL page, with the Python exercises and code that were submitted to FreeCodeCamp for my certificate there:<br>

									<h3>HackerRank</h3>
									<p><p>HackerRank is a website much like LeetCode, that provides both instruction and confirmation of coding ability. So far, I've certified on the site that I have basic Python and SQL knowledge, and as of October 26th, have three stars under Python, and two stars under SQL.
									<br>
									Here's my HackerRank profile link:<br>

									<h3>FrontEnd Web Development</h3>
									<p>Before I had entered into the Merit America Program, I had concluded that it may take much longer than a few months to break into the Data Analysis role that I wanted to prepare for. 
									Due to this, I had decided to turn my efforts towards Front End Web Development, and refreshing the knowledge I had previously to approach a job in Technology by a different route. As I had already visited 
									FreeCodeCamp for the Data Analysis for Python course, I revisited the site for the other courses in Responsive Web Design, and Javascript data structures and algorithms. I was in the process of 
									completing both of these courses, along with the Web Developer BootCamp offered by Colt Steele on Udemy. These are still in progress, but will be on the back burner until I complete the Merit America Program. 
									For now, this page will serve as part of what skills were learned in those courses. </p>

									<h3>Ludum Dare 49: Electro-Twixt</h3>
									<p>This was the first Game Jam I've participated in. This particular game jam challenges developers to create and complete a game within 3 days. This started on October 1st, and ended on October 4th, and the theme for the jam was "Unstable".
										My partner has had a passion for programming and game design for decades, and participates in these jams to enhance his skills and work under both a theme and a deadline. Thankfully I was able to participate with him on this one, providing the menus and most of the pixel art. We completed the game barely ontime, and while 
										we did not place very high, we did enjoy the process and the community effort along the way.
