							<p> The last certification I'd gotten was back in October, and it's been a pretty busy month since. Holidays and birthdays have been nice to celebrate, but now it's time to get back into the swing of things. The last certification I had gotten was in October, in order to 
							join the first cohort of the Data Analytics program offered by Merit America. In the three weeks since, I've learned that the course they use for the technical part of the skills being taught is the Google Data Analytics course. However, they do also offer a lot of robust
							 knowledge in career placement and coaching. 
							</p>
							<p>
							I did discover that Coursera allows you to reset the deadlines on your course if you would like to follow along again, check out updated content, or restart again should you miss the deadlines that you set before. I've reset the deadlines, to follow along and refresh any gaps
							in what I had learned previously, but did learn that my certificates have the previous date set on them when presented. I've also started another course, Excel Fundamentals for Data Analysis, to ensure that I know this and Google Sheets for spreadsheet software projects.
							Once I complete this specialization, I'll need to decide if more courses can be taken, or if I can make more progress on HackerRank and DataCamp. 
							</p>
							<p>
							One of the job seeking hurdles I did not know I may be butting up against is the ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems). These are now used by almost every employer to manage the applicants they receive. Understandably they receive a lot of resumes and applications, and also need 
							a way to filter down the applications to their needed requirements. The reason this is important is because I had an old fashioned notion that making my resume visually interesting with long explainations for each job would be the best way to not only capture the hiring manager's attention, but detail
							how I can take my previous career experience and translate it into actionable skills and knowledge that can be used in Data Analytics. However, I've recently learned that this is certainly not the case.
							</p>
							<p>
							Thankfully, the extra coursework through Merit America has provided good advice on how to update my Resume along with my LinkedIn account for networking. I've updated my LinkedIn profile to reflect the skills I've learned through the Google Data Analytics course, along with
							generating a resume from the profile that details my experience, skills, and certifications. I feel a bit silly for not considering this earlier, but I am thankful that I have learned this now. 
							</p>
							<p>
							Finally, I have applied to a few positions, and if you happen to be at this page because of that, Hello! Some of that data is going to be turned into a personal project, depending on how long it takes to gain a position, and will be posted here with averages and other reports.
							I'll try to keep this updated once a week, however coursework and home obligations may take priority as the holiday season goes underway. If you happen to have any questions, use the form under "Contact" on the Portfolio page to send me an email, and I'll get back to you within
							a day or two. 
							Hope you have a wonderful rest of your day, and thanks for taking a moment to check in!
							</p>
