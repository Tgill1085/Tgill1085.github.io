								This post is a bit sooner than last time, however I did not want to forget to do so in all the Thanksgiving preparations and festivities. I've been doing some extra projects today, to be sure that I am keeping my skills in practice. I still have a subscription with Coursera, and decided to take a few guided projects and a course. 
								Below you'll find three embedded Tableau visualizations, each made for a different project. When I get around to re-arranging the portfolio side of the website, these will be then later displayed in that section, as I plan on separating out my SQL, R, Python, Viz, and any other projects out for ease of review. <br><br>

								There we go! Thanks for taking a moment to visit, and hope you're having a wonderful rest of your week!

							<p> It's been a bit longer than planned, but I'm still here! :) <br>
							I've been pretty busy with the Merit America program, as it has us particpate in the Google Data Analytics course at an accelerated rate, along with career coaching.
							Thankfully I've completed the course, and a bit of this is just refreshing material and knowledge for me. However, I've also been updating my LinkedIn, growing my connections,
							and sending out my Resume to actively seek an Entry Level Role.<br>
							I have gotten some constructive feedback on my resume, and I believe that showing more projects and work may help with the fact that I am transitioning into the career. However, 
							I've also evaluated the portfolio site and Github repository in general, and found that it may be a bit unorganized. What I'll be working on this week is changing the projects section 
							to reflect all projects under their respective technologies, and sort them by most recent. Not only this, but I will also be doing additional projects as proof of skill. In the mean time, 
							it may look a bit of a mess as I get this tuned in. If you happen to visit the page in this time, and see that, please be assured I am continuing to work on this! Other than this, hope you have a wonderful rest of your day, and thanks for taking a moment to check in!

							<p> The last certification I'd gotten was back in October, and it's been a pretty busy month since. Holidays and birthdays have been nice to celebrate, but now it's time to get back into the swing of things. The last certification I had gotten was in October, in order to 
							join the first cohort of the Data Analytics program offered by Merit America. In the three weeks since, I've learned that the course they use for the technical part of the skills being taught is the Google Data Analytics course. However, they do also offer a lot of robust
							 knowledge in career placement and coaching. 
							</p>
							<p>
							I did discover that Coursera allows you to reset the deadlines on your course if you would like to follow along again, check out updated content, or restart again should you miss the deadlines that you set before. I've reset the deadlines, to follow along and refresh any gaps
							in what I had learned previously, but did learn that my certificates have the previous date set on them when presented. I've also started another course, Excel Fundamentals for Data Analysis, to ensure that I know this and Google Sheets for spreadsheet software projects.
							Once I complete this specialization, I'll need to decide if more courses can be taken, or if I can make more progress on HackerRank and DataCamp. 
							</p>
							<p>
							One of the job seeking hurdles I did not know I may be butting up against is the ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems). These are now used by almost every employer to manage the applicants they receive. Understandably they receive a lot of resumes and applications, and also need 
							a way to filter down the applications to their needed requirements. The reason this is important is because I had an old fashioned notion that making my resume visually interesting with long explainations for each job would be the best way to not only capture the hiring manager's attention, but detail
							how I can take my previous career experience and translate it into actionable skills and knowledge that can be used in Data Analytics. However, I've recently learned that this is certainly not the case.
							</p>
							<p>
							Thankfully, the extra coursework through Merit America has provided good advice on how to update my Resume along with my LinkedIn account for networking. I've updated my LinkedIn profile to reflect the skills I've learned through the Google Data Analytics course, along with
							generating a resume from the profile that details my experience, skills, and certifications. I feel a bit silly for not considering this earlier, but I am thankful that I have learned this now. 
							</p>
							<p>
							Finally, I have applied to a few positions, and if you happen to be at this page because of that, Hello! Some of that data is going to be turned into a personal project, depending on how long it takes to gain a position, and will be posted here with averages and other reports.
							I'll try to keep this updated once a week, however coursework and home obligations may take priority as the holiday season goes underway. If you happen to have any questions, use the form under "Contact" on the Portfolio page to send me an email, and I'll get back to you within
							a day or two. 
							Hope you have a wonderful rest of your day, and thanks for taking a moment to check in!
